What TypeScript does : Static Checking , staticly check our code at run time wehn coding in IDE the IDE checks for any run time error , but this cant be achieve in JavaScript
Analyze the code as we type.That's it

TS is not just a standalone langiage . It's a development tool. Your  project stills runs JavaScript
